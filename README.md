# 8085 Microprocessor Kit Simulator

This project is an Android simulator for the 8085 microprocessor kit commonly used in colleges and universities. It provides a realistic interface resembling the actual kit and offers features such as executing assembly language code, inspecting memory, and inserting values into memory. The simulator is developed using Kotlin and XML, ensuring a smooth and user-friendly experience.

## Features

- Assembly Language Execution: The simulator allows you to write and execute assembly language programs, mimicking the functionality of the 8085 microprocessor.
- Memory Inspection: You can inspect the contents of memory locations to understand the state of the system during program execution.
- Memory Manipulation: The simulator provides the ability to insert values into memory, enabling you to modify the contents as needed.
- Realistic Interface: The user interface closely resembles the physical kit, providing a familiar experience to students who are accustomed to working with the actual hardware.

## Installation

To run the 8085 Microprocessor Kit Simulator on your Android device, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/8085-microprocessor-kit-simulator.git
   ```

2. Open the project in Android Studio or any compatible IDE.

3. Connect your Android device to the computer and ensure that USB debugging is enabled.

4. Build and run the project on your device from the IDE.

   **Note:** You can also use the Android emulator to run the simulator if you don't have a physical device.

## Usage

Upon launching the simulator, you will be greeted with the interface resembling the 8085 microprocessor kit. Here are the main components of the simulator and how to use them:

- Assembly Language Editor: Write your assembly language code in this section. You can use the provided editor to create, modify, and save programs.
- Memory Viewer: This section displays the contents of the memory locations. You can scroll through the memory and inspect the stored values.
- Execution Controls: Use the control buttons to execute, step through, pause, and reset the execution of the program.
- Register Viewer: The register viewer shows the values stored in the registers during program execution.
- Input/Output: If your program requires input or produces output, you can use this section to interact with the simulated devices.
- Status Bar: The status bar displays relevant information such as the current program counter, program status word, and other system details.
